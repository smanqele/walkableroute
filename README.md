walkableroute
================
A Star Algorithm for building a route given a 2-D graph

The project is called walkableroute.

There are four(4) source package structures: 1. za.co.app.logger (1 source file) 2. za.co.graph.source (2 source files) 3. za.co.model.entities (4 source files) 4. za.co.model.route (4 source files)

There is a "resource" folder in the project root which contains the input map file plus a test file.

There is a "resources/logs" folder in the project root which contains the application log files. Each new application spawns a new log file.

The file za.co.model.route.RouteBuilder is the execution point for the project.

The result is created in a new "result" file for reference purposes.
